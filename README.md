# STUDY APP (Express)

Study App is a persona project that can be viewed at <a href='https://thomasgrz-studyapp.herokuapp.com'>Heroku</a>

Study App is meant to assist with studying and focus.
It is based off the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique'>Pomorodo Method</a>

If you would like to see or use it in real time, simply clone the repo, go into the `timer.js` file and change top line to:

```
INTERVAL_RATE = 1000
```

This will change it to real time.

This application is currently under production as I am working on adding user authentication with PassportJS and data aggregation with PostgreSQL.
